# GameCo
This project was part of CareerFoundry's Data Analytics course in which I analyzed GameCo's new games in Excel.
# Objective 
 GameCo wants to use data to inform the development of new games. As such, CameCo asked me to perform a descriptive analysis of a video game data set to foster a better understanding of how GameCo’s new games might fare in the market. GameCo executives are open to hearing any insights I can pull from the data but are specifically interested in these questions: 

● Are certain types of games more popular than others?  

● What other publishers will likely be the main competitors in certain markets?  

● Have any games decreased or increased in popularity over time?  

● How have their sales figures varied between geographic regions over time?  

# Data
The data set can be found here: [vgsales.xlsx](https://github.com/juleeanasuelee/GameCo/blob/main/vgsales.xlsx).
